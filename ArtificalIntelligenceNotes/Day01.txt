Enviroment
==========

Observable
----------
tic tac toe
chess

Partially Observable
--------------------
Self Driving Taxi

>Attributes
->Is the place that the AI Agent can move.
->Deterministic //Can know the outcome if i do this action *Tree* eg. Tic tac to
->Stochastic //You can't know the outcome eg. AI Taxi drive
->Descrete // Can we say about the performance metric yes/no
->Continuous //There is multip matric to evaluate th
->Static // The Enviroment can only change by the Agent factor
->Dynamic // The Enviroment can change without your factor eg. Taxi driver and it rains
->SemiDynamic
->Sequential //stand alone
->Episodic //Conected to each other
->Stratigatic

Agent
=====

->Agent should work Rationally
->Agent takes choices and Actions in the Actuators using the Precept he Have.

>Sensors //Use to collect Information
>Precept //The information
>Actuators //Are the tools used to take actions
>Omniscience //In reality it is Impossible to know everything
>Performance matric //For every agent there could be multiple matrics meassures

Self Driving Taxi


Types of Agents
===============

1)Simple Reflex Agent //If-Else
-------------------------------

2)Model reflexive
-----------------
Check what is the outcome

3)Goal Agent
------------
Keep Trying to reach the goal

4)Utility Agent
---------------
Keep trying to reach the, But perfomance Matric is took. eg. 80% is better than 60%

LEARNING AGENT
--------------
Experience is took, To better the performance

===========
Exercise

Senario
=======
A drone that fights in a battelfield, there is alot of drones fliying together and Attacking targets

Performance: Accurracy, number of kills, efficeincy, Survivability
-----------

Enviroment: Battlefield, buildings, weather, planes, Air Deffence
----------

Actuators: Rocketlaunchers, blades, motor, wings, lights
---------

Sensors: Camers, infrared, radar, barometer, 
-------

Observability: partial, Because the drone can't see by the camera sensor the whole battelfield
-------------

Deterministic/Stochastic: Deterministic, Because the ations are known, There is no randomness.
-------------------------

Static/Dynamic: Dynamic // There is alot of factors that may effect the drone in the battelfield
---------------

Single/Multi Agent: Multi Agent as mentioned in the senario
-------------------
